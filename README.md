Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is crucial in integrating AI systems into healthcare,
where trust and transparency are vital. This project explores the use of XAI in diagnosing
diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. By leveraging SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations) and its optimized version, TreeSHAP, we demonstrate how machine
learning predictions can be interpreted and trusted by clinicians.
